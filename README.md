# Mwangwego Tracing Font

This repository is created to support the development of a Mwangwego script tracing font.

This font should be based on the 
[Athinkra Mwangwego Book font](https://github.com/athinkra/mwangwego-book)
and applies the `Dots With Arrows` style of the 
[Ge'ez Handwriting Fonts](https://github.com/raeytype/geez-handwriting-fonts?tab=readme-ov-file#with-arrows-1)
to all letters and marks.
